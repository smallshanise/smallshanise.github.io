<div>  <p style="font-family:helvetica;">Its a late afternoon and she just finished her homework. She's tired but restless. The only things running through her mind was either to just turn in early or to have some fun. She had been sitting
    on her bed contemplating. Her new plush silk sheets brushing against skin. Her bed was definatly calling her name. Why not? she desevred it. She lays down but as soon as she does her phone rings. On the line is a boy she met not long ago.
 He was a lot of fun and she knew exactly what he was calling for. She'd be lying to herself if she said she did'nt want to either. Should she ignore him and Sleep or Anwser the phone.</p></div>
