  <p style="font-family:helvetica; "> I explore different Ideas and push the boundaries to the point where expressing the abstract themes come easy . My work is mostly of me showing the world my world or my private life since I truly believe I have nothing to hide such as themes revloing sex, self-worth and body positivty.
I create these pieces because I’m constantly on the search to find my inner self, constantly contemplating whether I’m worth everyone gives me credit for. Since I started doing art around these topics, I’ve become more and more alive. As I continue I’d like to show others that truly finding yourself takes time and effort and will come over time.
